            <p>I got into Bitcoin in 2015 and started working fulltime in crypto in 2021.</p>
            <p>Projects that have influenced me the most include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cosmos. They each have their own take on the blockchain trilema and I find that very interesting.</p>
            <p>Blockchains are digital hammers and everything from money to the open internet is a digital nail.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I have a systems engineering degree but I am not an engineer by trade. In the web3 space, I work on strategy, business development, and partnerships.</p>
            <p>My technical background designing and implementing large systems on multidisciplinary teams combined with my business development skills are my superpower.</p>
            <p>Don't let this fancy website trick you into thinking I can code. I can read but not write. AI wrote the HTML and CSS that brought this site to your eyes.</p>

        <section id="philosophy">
            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Curiosity. I believe curiosity is one of the most important human characteristics. I think humans who are drawn to asking difficult questions and put the work in to </p>
            <p>seeking out the true answers tend to be both happy and successful. Curiosity and humility are related in that someone who is very curious must have some degree of</p>
            <p>humility.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Execution. I believe that execution is very important. It is really important to not just be an idea person. You need to implement things and see your ideas through.</p>
            <p>This applies to little things and big things.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Decentralization. I believe in the power of atomic and distributed systems. This concept goes beyond technology for me. I think society, culture, food, politics, as well as </p>
            <p>the Internet have all gotten too centralized and top heavy. I believe Bitcoin started us on a path towards a more decentralized form of humanity as it provided a</p>
            <p>key primitives necessary to establish a sovereign network using inexpensive digital tools only. The book The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson, Michael David Axtell</p>
            <p>greatly helped me see this centralized-decentralized pendulum more clearly.</p>

            <p>My LinkedIn profile below is probably the best way to review my work. I can also send you a resume if you email me.</p>
