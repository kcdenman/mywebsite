PHILOSOPHY:
Virtues:
- Curiosity: Believes curiosity is one of the most important human characteristics. It can be practiced and learned.
- Gratitude: Having an abundance of gratitude adds immense value to daily life and is a partial root to happiness.
- Execution: Fostering an ability and desire to get things done is empowering and incrementally builds confidence.

Bitcoin:
- Separation of Money and State: Money is a technology that has taken many forms and been controlled by different entities. The US Dollar's role in the global monetary system has only been around since 1944.
- Decentralization: Believes in the power of atomic and distributed systems. Centralization has maxed out and is now generating more perverse effects than benefits. Bitcoin started us on a path towards a more decentralized form of humanity.
- Internet-Native Money: The Internet needs its own native money infrastructure to reduce economic friction within its network. Native money infrastructure allows the Internet to approach a zero-friction transaction settlement layer.

Bitcoin Reference Materials:
- You can download the Bitcoin Whitepaper to understand its purpose and design.

FULL BLOG POSTS:

1. The Economy of Trust: How Bitcoin will lead to a thriving global economy
Bitcoin's core value proposition is much more nuanced than headlines suggest. It's not just a better currency, an alternative to gold, or a more distributed immutable database. These are just applications of a far more valuable concept: platforming the Economy of Trust. The Economy of Trust can be thought of as the value derived from a system's ability to provision, maintain and verify information in a way that can be fully trusted. Today, the Economy of Trust is maintained by an ecosystem of trusted intermediaries, such as banks, auditors and credit agencies. In the future, Bitcoin will increasingly serve the role as a more efficient and resilient 'trusted intermediary'â€”one that does not rely on centralized authority or suffer from the same vulnerabilities. This is the core value of Bitcoin as a platform. (Full essay content available in the blog post.)

2. The Rise of Cybereconomic Smart Agents
The emergence of the cybereconomy began about 25 years ago when internet use began to evolve from a read-only medium to a read-write medium that could support an entirely new class of write-oriented use cases like ecommerce, blogs, and social networks. Builders in the crypto space have spent the last decade retooling the internet with digital ownership and cybereconomies at its very core. Blockchain infrastructure will also spawn the rise of a new actor - the Cybereconomic Smart Agent. (Full essay content available in the blog post.)

3. Can Crypto Reduce Friction and Create a Boom for Micro-Loans?
The ascent of micro-loans is an inspiring story. It has all the makings of a rags to riches fairy tale whereby a poor, underserved individual gets access to credit and is able to compound this credit into a more prosperous future. Grameen Bank remains the poster child for the micro-loans sector. In short, Grameen bank devised a risk model that enabled them to disperse micro-loans (typically no greater than $2,000) to individuals without any collateral. (Full essay content available in the blog post.)

4. Bitcoin is Exponential Growth, Not a Bubble
There are several examples of bubbles in history, which in retrospect, all look the same. Here is how they all unfold: Step one: a few people start making an insane amount of money. Step two: lay investors follow suit, and start ploughing money into a nebulous financial asset. Step three: due to the capital influx, the financial asset appreciates to an incomprehensible, astronomical level. Step four: someone realizes the value of the financial asset cannot be reconciled with the underlying real assets. Step five: a sell-off ensues, causing the bubble to pop, and the value of the financial asset plummets as quickly as it appreciated. Why is Bitcoin different? Many financial analysts are shouting "bubble" from the rooftops because step one, two, and three above do apply to Bitcoin. Step four, however, is when real differences emerge.
