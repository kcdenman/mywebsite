            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Below are some virtues and principles that have enduring significance for me. Their inclusion does not necessarily imply that I have mastered them, but rather that I strive to live up to these ideals.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Curiosity.</b> I believe curiosity is one of the most important human characteristics. Those who are drawn to find answers to difficult questions tend to be both happy and successful.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Execution.</b> I believe that execution is very important. It is really important to not just be an idea person. You need to implement things and see your ideas through. This applies to little things and big things.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Gratitude.</b> I believe that having an abundance of gratitude will add value to your daily life. Gratitude for those who came before you and made sacrifices. Gratitude for those in your life right now making it better. Gratitude for those who oppose you and cause you to self reflect.</p>
            <p></p>
            
            <p><b>Decentralization.</b> I believe in the power of atomic and distributed systems. This concept goes beyond technology for me. I think society, culture, food, politics, as well as the Internet have all gotten too centralized and top heavy. On average, I think this centralization has led to perverse effects. I believe Bitcoin started us on a path towards a more decentralized form of humanity as it provided a key primitives necessary to establish a sovereign network using inexpensive digital tools only. The book The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson, Michael David Axtell greatly helped me see this centralized-decentralized pendulum more clearly.</p>
